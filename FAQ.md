# FAQ

#### I'm getting an error along the lines of "OSError [Errorno 13] Permission Denied" when I try to install Pip!
* Try adding '--user' in the command line when running the pip install file!

#### I'm not able to run my python script
* It's possible that you have multiple versions of python installed. Try using `python3.6` instead of `python` when you run the program in terminal. If you see `command not found`, it means you don't have that version of python, so follow the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/) to install Python 3.6.
